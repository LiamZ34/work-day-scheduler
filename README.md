# work-day-scheduler

For this homework our purpose was to make a work day scheduler in which dependant on the time you schedule to do something wether it be before or after or at the current time, it would be color coordinated, so gray means past, red means present, and green means future 

the acceptance criteria for this project was:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
